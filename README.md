# SoC Developement
This project focuses on System on Chip (SoC) development and the integration of hardware and software. Utilizing the MicroBlaze MCS softcore processor on an Atrix-7 Basys 3 development board, this project demonstrates my independent work in designing and integrating various peripherals and custom code. While the project draws inspiration from the textbook "FPGA Prototyping with SystemVerilog" by Pong P. Chu and utilizes some base peripherals, the majority have been independently developed by me.
